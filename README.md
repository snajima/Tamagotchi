## Overview:

In this project we attempt to implement the Tamagotchi experience using low-level OCaml modules. By utilizing simple and cute pixel art and an array of interactive mini-games, we attempted to recreate the wholesome childhood experience. Specifically, there are three mini-games: dolphin obstacle, drumming rhythm, and elementals (our version of rock-paper-scissors) game.

The player is also able to take care of their Tamagotchi pet by feeding it, letting it sleep, and cleaning up after it. In the home menu, the Tamagotchiâ€™s statuses (happiness, sleep, cleanliness, and hunger) are displayed numerically, and if any of them drop to 0, the Tamagotchi passes away. As a result, the player has to strategically take care of their Tamagotchi. Subsequent features were also added like age and system time (which corresponds to either a sun or moon displayed on the home screen)
